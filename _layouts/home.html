				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					I am a web developer, UI/UX architect/designer, as well as filling many other roles as needed in many diverse projects. I have worked for a couple of large universities including the University of Georgia and Clemson University. Working at UGA and Clemson has really driven my hunger to learn as much as I can to make their web presences leaders in the industy. I love learning new software that challenges my critical thinking and also going back to enhance skills I have been working on for years.  I am excited to branch out with my skills, continuously growing as a professional.

					I grew up in the flat lands of rural Iowa until I was about 18 years old. Since then, I have lived near the Appalachian Mountains and hiking has become one of my favorite hobbies. When I am not exploring new trails with my wife, Jill, and our golden retriever, Quasky, I also genuinely enjoy watching and playing sports. I was on the rugby team for the University of South Carolina, played in men's leagues, and now I am a coach with the Greenville Griffins men's team. I also love playing golf, disc golf, and any type of pick-up sport that calls for getting outside.

					Sports have been a centralized part of my life, and fueled the competitive edge that I have brought to my professional working career.
