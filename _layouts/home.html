				<p>
					I am a web developer and UI/UX architect/designer. I have worked for a couple of large universities including the University of Georgia and Clemson University. Working at UGA and Clemson really drove my hunger to learn as much as I can to make their web presences leaders in the industy. I love learning new software that challenges my critical thinking and enhancing skills I have been working on for years.  I am excited to branch out with my skills and continuously grow as a professional.

					I grew up in the flatlands of rural Iowa until I was about 18 years old. Since then, I have lived near the Appalachian Mountains and hiking has become one of my favorite hobbies. When I am not exploring new trails with my wife, Jill, and our golden retriever, Quasky, I also enjoy watching and playing sports. In college I played rugby for the University of South Carolina and then participated in men's leagues into my early thirites. I am now a coach with the Greenville Griffins Rugby Club. I also love playing golf, disc golf, and any type of pick-up sport that calls for getting outside.

				<p>
					Sports have been a centralized part of my life, and fueled the competitive edge that I have brought to my professional working career.
